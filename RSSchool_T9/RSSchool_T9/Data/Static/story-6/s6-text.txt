The sky
Is all we have
It's the city
Of the last chance
The sky
Go bitter if you're weak
But I hope we will try
To turn in ether everything

The Sky's The Limit
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
Money fallin' from the
Money fallen' from the sky sky
Money fallin' from

SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!!
SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!!
SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!!
SKY HIGH!! SKY HIGH!!
